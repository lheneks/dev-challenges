## Overview
Count the number of occurrences of each character in a string and output the results.


/*
    input: A big car
    output: A : 1
      ' ' : 2
      b: 1
      c: 1
      g: 1
      i: 1
      ...
*/


## Refinement
* What changes would you make to output the results by most frequent occurrence first?
* What changes would you make to support occurences of substrings (more than one character)?

## Alternatives
What other way(s) can you think of to accomplish the same thing and what are some pros and cons?
